<p>And then that paper towel damp and soggy from doing it’s job gets tossed in teh trash usually before we even sit down for our meal.</p>

<p>Often this paper towel plays a preventative role and isn’t even that dirty.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The goal of this site is not increased consumerism, and if you already have purchased items in your home that are still functional the best thing you can do is to continue using them. So don’t go throwing out your plastic dish scrummber in favor of natural fiber product in an effort to be more green. The products you have in your house have already been made and the impact to the environment has already happened. By throwing it out and buying new items even if they are ‘better’ it is still a net-increase in waste of our resources. Resist the urge to shop until you have a need.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As tempting as it may be to go out and buy a bunch of new products that are better for your wallet and earth than whatever you currently have lying around at home already– do not do it!]]></summary></entry></feed>
